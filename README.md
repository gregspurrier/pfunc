# PFunc
PFunc is a [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/) compliant promise implementation. PFunc's promise is a Node.js-style callback function accepting error and result arguments. When invoked, the promise is fulfilled or rejected based on the arguments. The promise also has fulfill() and reject() methods for more traditional resolution.
